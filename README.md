# Challenge_06

I am doing a financial analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco by using an interactive visualizations.

For this challenge, my data visualization will be included the aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis. At the end of this challenge the interactive map will help any investors to decide which area of San Francisco are more profitable.
I used Python as programming language and I import some of the libraries that we will need like panda, hvplot and pathlib.
